# hello-world

Hi everyone!

My name is aaron, I am a field enginieer. but I do not like my current job, I am thinking about change my job to be a software enginieer.
which I do not have any experience and know nothing about. there are tremondous difficuty front, and i suffer a lot when i relised that most of the person that in this business is compalitive young, and this job needs a very wide of experence not only based in programme skill, but also in other field like math. I know I maybe a little old, and not that smart. but I do know i do not want to be a field engineer in the following years. So, even I may not be a software engineer, I still want to have a try and win my chance.
